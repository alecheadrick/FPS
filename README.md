# FPS
FPS for Grand Circus/
Fire is left mouse click each gun does different damage/
  hellwailer damage = 100/
  firesleet damage = 30/
  grimbrand damage = 10/
Drones and barrels have 100 health each which you can adjust on the objects on the target script/
there are lots of extra variables on each object that i plan on ironing out soon/
code is not the neatest code but it gets the job done but on the upside im learning/
ps there is a second scene featuring a lava map if the original one gets boring/
psps the file size is larger than it should be due to unused assets that need to be cleaned up(i plan on cleaning later/
pspsps i put a different .gitignore into the project to hopefully cut down on the size/
