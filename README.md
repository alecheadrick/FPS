FPS for Grand Circus
Fire is left mouse click each gun does different damage
  /hellwailer damage = 100
  /firesleet damage = 30
  /grimbrand damage = 10
Drones and barrels have 100 health each which you can adjust on the objects on the target script
there are lots of extra variables on each object that i plan on ironing out soon
code is not the neatest code but it gets the job done but on the upside im learning
